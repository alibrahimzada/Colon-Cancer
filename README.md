# Colon-Cancer
Exploring the Supervised Learning Models to Automatically Diagnose Colon Cancer Patients based on their SNP Profiles. 

The goal of this analysis is to explore the machine learning-based automatic diagnosis of colorectal patients based on the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Such a computational approach may be used complementary to other diagnosis tools, such as, biopsy, CT scan, and MRI. Moreover, it may be used as a low-cost screening for colorectal cancers to improve public health.
